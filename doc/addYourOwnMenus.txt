You can define your own menus and toolbar buttons, which 
can execute any Python code and also external files.  

Look at 'framework/menus/Extra.py' for an example.


Instructions:

<b>Step 1:</b>
Suppose you want to add a new menu with the name 'XXX' to the
menubar. Create a new file with the name XXX.py in the 
'framework/menus/' directory


<b>Step2:</b>
Import or define some actions, with the following structure:

def action(script,app,event):
    ...

The arguments of the function are:
script      -> current script window
app         -> application window
event       -> event

Some usefull stuff:
    script.fileName
    script.source
        script.source.GetText()
        script.source.SetText(text)
        script.source.GetSelectedText()
        script.source.ReplaceSelection(text)
    app.run(fileName)             -> runs an external file
    app.new()                     -> creates a new file
    app.open(fileName,lineno,col) -> opens a file at given position
    app.message(text)             -> shows a dialog window with the text
    app.messageEntry(text)        -> shows a dialog prompting an entry
    app.messageError(text)        -> shows an error dialog window with the text
    app.SetStatus(text)           -> sets the status text


<b>Step3:</b>
Define the 'main' function:

def main(app):
    menu(app,
        item(label=<str:label that will appear in menu>,
             action=<function:that will be called>),
        item(...),
        SEPARATOR,
        item(...),
        item(...),
        ...
        SEPARATOR,
        item(...),
        ...
    )

If you want this menu item also to have a toolbar button, than
make a 16x16pixels png image (transparency is allowed). The image
has to be located in the menu folder.  Pass the the fileName with
the toolbar keyword:  

        item(label=<str:label that will appear in menu>,
             action=<function:that will be called>,
		 toolbar=<str:fileName of the toolbar image (optional)>)
